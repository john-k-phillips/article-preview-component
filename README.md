<!-- REPLACE TASKS -->
<h2>Overview</h2>
Your challenge is to build out this article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:
- [x] Only use JavaScript for initiating the share options.
- [x] View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See the social media share links when they click the share icon

<h2>Satisfaction</h2>
<h3>The Good</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I like the use of flexbox with the mobile design.</li>
    <li>I'm happy with how fast I was able to create a toggleable menu.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The responsive design was rushed and I'm not satisfied with it.</li>
    <li>Git commits were all over the place and rushed. Something I don't normally do, It's important to me that I don't repeat this.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>The Process</h2>

  <img alt="CSS3" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS3-blue?style=flat-square&logo=css3&logoColor=white" />
  <img alt="JavaScript" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-yellow?style=flat-square&logo=JavaScript&logoColor=white" />
  
  <img alt="SASS" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-SASS-bf4080?style=flat-square&logo=sass&logoColor=white" />
</p>
<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    I don't often get to use active and non active stats within CSS, using JavaScript to create a toggleable share feature was fun.
    My previous projects have used state management tools like react, so having pure JS was interesting.
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    I would like to redo the desktop design, the responsive nature of the page is very off and definitely needs repairs.
