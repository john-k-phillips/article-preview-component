<!-- REPLACE TASKS -->
<h2>Overview</h2>
Your challenge is to build out this article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:
- [x] Only use JavaScript for initiating the share options.
- [x] View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See the social media share links when they click the share icon

<h3>The Bad</h3>

  </ul>

<h2>The Process</h2>
<h3>Tools</h3>

<h3>What I Learnt<h3>
  <p>
    I don't often get to use active and non active stats within CSS, using JavaScript to create a toggleable share feature was fun.
    My previous projects have used state management tools like react, so having pure JS was interesting.
  </p>
<h3>Continuted Development</h3>
  <p>
    I would like to redo the desktop design, the responsive nature of the page is very off and definitely needs repairs.
